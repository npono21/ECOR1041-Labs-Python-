==========

Exercise 1: Single or Double Quotes - Does it matter?

Example, "haven't" or '"Spam, spam, spam," he said.'

>>> type('Hello')
# Type what you see: <class 'str'>

>>> type("goodbye")
# Type what you see: <class 'str'>

>>> 'Hello'
# Type what you see: 'Hello'

>>> ""     (An empty string - type two quotes with no spaces between them.)
# Type what you see:''

>>> '"Spam, spam, spam," he said.'
# Type what you see: '"Spam, spam, spam," he said.'

>>> "I haven't a clue" 
# Type what you see: "I haven't a clue"

>>> 'I haven't a clue' 
# Type what you see: builtins.IndentationError

Concluding Questions: Generally, either double or single quotes works well but can you give a scenario where one is better than the other?
Double quote are usually use to write a str message or something of the sort while single quotes are usually used to right
a symbol such as 'English' or 'Addition'.
==================

Exercise 2: What operations are permitted with values of type str?

When used with strings, + is the concatenation operator. 

>>> 'Hello, ' + 'world!'
# Type what you see: 'Hello, world!'

When used with strings, * is the replication operator.

>>> "Spam" * 3
# Type what you see: 'SpamSpamSpam'

>>> 3 * "Spam"
# Type what you see:'SpamSpamSpam' (The order of operators does not matter).

>>> "Spam" * 0
# Type what you see: ''

>>> "Spam" * -3
# Type what you see: ''

There are other operators to try now: - and /

>>> "Hello" - "He"
# Type what you see: builtins.TypeError

>>> 'Spam' / 3
# Type what you see: builtins.TypeError


Concluding Questions: What operators work with strings?  Does the order of operands matter?
According to the above results, the operators "+" and "*" work with strings and the order of operators does not matter.
=======================

Exercise 3 : Understand the string representation

Is  the string '123' the same as the integer 123? 

>>> '123' + 456
# Type what you see: builtins.TypeError

>>> '123' + '456'
# Type what you see: '123456'

Concluding Question: When a string looks like a number, is it a number or a string?
When a string looks like a number, it is still a string no matter what unless there is a function within the code causing the 
compiler to interpret the string as a number.
